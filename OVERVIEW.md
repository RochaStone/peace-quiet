### Investment Indication

Based on our conversation, I'm confident this project sits in the region of **$18,000 USD**.

This is subject to full scope once the discovery questions are answered. Depending on integration complexity (particularly the prescription system and CRM setup), this could increase.

### Discovery Questions

Before I can finalise scope and provide a formal quote, I need some details clarified. Since this is a new business launching fresh, many of these are about what systems you're planning to use rather than what exists.

**Prescriptions**
1. What system will practitioners use to write scripts?
2. Does it have an API, or will clinic staff enter prescription data into the portal manually?
3. What prescription details should patients see in their dashboard?

**Patient Data & CRM**
4. Are you planning to use HubSpot? If so, what tier?
5. What patient information will be stored in the CRM?
6. Should patient activity in the portal sync back to the CRM?

**Content (Think & Do)**
7. Who will create the educational content — articles, videos, podcasts?
8. Same content for all patients, or personalised by treatment type?

**Patient Accounts**
9. How will patient accounts be created — self-signup after consultation, or clinic creates them?

**Appointments**
10. What booking system will you use? (Calendly, Acuity, other?)
11. Should the portal integrate with bookings, or just link out?

**Rewards & Incentives**
12. Is the rewards system needed for launch, or a future phase?
13. How will rewards work — discount codes, partner referrals, points?

**Technical**
14. What domain will the portal live on?
15. Any specific Australian healthcare compliance requirements?

**Timeline**
16. Target launch date?
17. Who will be my main contact for decisions during the build?

### Next Steps

1. Review the prototype with the founder
2. Answer the discovery questions above
3. I'll provide a final scope and quote

Happy to jump on a call with you and the founder once you've had a chance to look through everything.
